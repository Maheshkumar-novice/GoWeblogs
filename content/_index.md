Hey, There! I'm Maheshkumar. I love to **debug** when things go wrong. 

> "Debugging code? Think of it as solving a mystery. Track down those pesky bugs that messed up your code, fix them up, and make sure everything runs smoothly again."

I mostly work with **python**, **postgres** & **kafka**. I try to contribute to open source projects in the way I can.

Always grateful to the [The Odin Project](https://theodinproject.com) and their friendly community.

Current plans,
- Try to write here often
- Preparation for the `Advent Of Code 2024` using the [this](https://cses.fi/book/book.pdf)

Ideas to explore,
- Write a blog about learnings from using `splitlines` vs iterating the string directly
- Check about for loop vs using map
- Check about how long threads will execute in python process as well as how OS interrupts. What will happen CPU intensive threads run for a long time? is it possible?
- Learn about thread local storage
- How to use multiple redis hosts? and why do we need it?
- How many threads is affordable in 4 CPU env?
- Write about the learnings I got when I was exploring about manual commit?
- Take and try kafka and redis official courses
