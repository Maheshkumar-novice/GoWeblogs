Today I've finally fine-tuned a model (from an example of course) with `axolotl`. It was a nice experience. I've learned a thing or two about models and model training flow.

While doing the fine-tuning I came across a nicely documented resources of huggingface to know more about the workings of `axolotl` and the impact huggingface have in the ML domain.

I think that's it for today? Probably.
