Hmmm...Wasted a lot of golden time. I should've done my planning better. Got into learning multiple things once and did nothing.

Reading `THE BOOK` has stopped. I'm currently learning about ML stuff - just to satisfy curiosity about ML eco-system. I got some good resources,

- https://github.com/axolotl-ai-cloud/axolotl - fine tuning library
- https://unsloth.ai/ - fine tuning library
- https://huggingface.co/datasets/mhenrichsen/alpaca_2k_test - dataset example
- https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.09685 - about lora
- https://github.com/tatsu-lab/stanford_alpaca - dataset format and stuff
- https://huggingface.co/docs/trl/en/sft_trainer - this is the low-level library that axolotl and unsloth use?

Hacktoberfest is around the corner. I'm not sure about my participation but let's see.

I've also explored about some low-level stuff about confluent kafka python package for some work purposes and kafka docs as well.

- https://github.com/confluentinc/confluent-kafka-python/blob/master/src/confluent_kafka/src/Consumer.c#L976
- https://docs.kafka-ui.provectus.io/ - a nice ui tool for kafka
- https://docs.confluent.io/kafka-clients/python/current/overview.html - good docs
- https://medium.com/@rramiz.rraza/kafka-programming-different-ways-to-commit-offsets-7bcd179b225a

I'm also exploring and using `tmux` with `iterm2` and it's been very good experience so far. I've also explored `podman` to run and test few stuff.

I've explored few good resources,

- https://python-type-challenges.zeabur.app/basic/typealias - for learning about python typing and stuff
- and read about articles explaining how `postgreSQL 17` can improve the speed of queries with `in` clause

So what now? Keep it simple.

I'll start exploring `THE BOOK` soon once I get some free time.
