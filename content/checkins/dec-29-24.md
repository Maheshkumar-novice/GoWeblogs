Today I saw the real performance enhancement of using `numpy` for array manipulations. Execution went from seconds to ms.

Documented here: https://github.com/Maheshkumar-novice/Advent-Of-Code-Solutions/tree/main/2015/Day-06

Also, using complied regex seems a good choice for repeated execution.

Thanks to Advent of Code, I've learned all these things. I've also found out that in regex we can use backreference to reference previous matched group like `\1`.

I've some ideas to implement few personal projects to learn more about FE stuff, DevOps and System Design aspects. Let's see how it goes. That project won't have closure, I'll buid that always.
