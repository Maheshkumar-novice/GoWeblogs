Explored `librdkafka` and `confluent-kafka-python` source. I could grasp a thing or two. I'm happy for that. Test cases help in understanding a library or a package, today I realised it fully.

Their test cases give me patterns to make approaches with their library. They have examples also. Probably tomorrow I'll wrap up my work with manual commit.

With respect to ML, I've explored the source of `axolotl` and `accelerate` libraries. They are well written. It was nice exploring both. I'm also trying to convert a python script into a shell script using `claude`, it worked greatly actually. The LLM is converting the code very easily with robust checks and all.

I've also revisited `logging` while exploring `axolotl`. Previously I had a plan to write a blog about python logging and how I configure it and my understanding of it but I didn't do it. But I'll write about it some other day.

Read this https://justine.lol/mutex/ today. It's always nice to explore new things. Thanks to HN!

I'll probably check these https://people.freebsd.org/~lstewart/articles/cpumemory.pdf, https://jvns.ca/blog/2024/10/01/terminal-colours/ later.
