Today I was reading few articles and found few resources such as https://www.cosmicpython.com/book/preface.html#_who_should_read_this_book from lobsters and hacker news.

One article was about how an engineer at google docs team fixed a strange bug. I've stored it in Raindrop.

https://thisdavej.com/share-python-scripts-like-a-pro-uv-and-pep-723-for-easy-deployment/#running-your-script-with-uv

This is a good article. I learned new things about `uv` and found out a tool to monitor file creation events in linux. I've heard about `pipx` but this article triggered me to explore more on that. I'll do that later.
