Today I was reading few articles and found few resources such as https://www.cosmicpython.com/book/preface.html#_who_should_read_this_book from lobsters and hacker news.

One article was about how an engineer at google docs team fixed a strange bug. I've stored it in Raindrop.

This is a good article. I learned new things about `uv` and found out a tool to monitor file creation events in linux. I've heard about `pipx` but this article triggered me to explore more on that. I'll do that later.

Found few things about `pipx`, `pyenv`. And `uv` - `--seed` and `--preview` options. As well as `uv tool`

`pydantic - encode (starlette, httpx, mkdocs) - fastapi - astral (ruff, uv)`
