Started with exploring how the C++ `sort` function works. Explored simple pointer arithmetic.

Things like `begin`, `end`, `rbegin` & `rend` was nice. It works on `vectors` and as well as `strings`. Array we pass differently, as by default it points to a pointer.

Nothing after that. August 20 also couldn't give enough time to learn. But it should not be the reason. So resuming on August 21.
