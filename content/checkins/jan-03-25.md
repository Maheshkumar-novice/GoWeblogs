There are a lot to explore. But to do that I should be more focused. Currently my attention scattered all around. If I see a new shiny thing I'll distract and start to learn more about that. Never going in depth or completing what I've started. The exception to this is Advent of Code. I've completed it. Like that I should be more focused on each day on a particular resource. At the same time I do not want to miss out good resources that I could through in a later period of time. So how can I do that?

Pick a resource and stick with it till its completion. Meanwhile If I encouter a new resource or a blog store it in raindrop with appropriate tags. We can Look Into It Later. But the thing is what resource should I choose to start with? I also want to do some hobby projects. But how do I manage all of this while maintaining my mental and physical health as well as my social life? Wow that's a lot.

But it should be manageable. Let's see. Maybe I'll take some time off to get away from doing additional things to plan first.

To planning...cheers...!
