Today I'm exploring the source code of https://github.com/redis/redis-py/tree/master (Redis Py) for a use case about Locks. While doing that I came across `time.monotonic` and when I dig deeper into that topic I found that usual `time.time()` could result in weird bugs for time calculation operations when system time changes. I wrote a TIL (https://github.com/Maheshkumar-novice/TIL/tree/main/python).

Regarding redis locks, I'll add TIL soon. This is what I understood while learning about redis locks. Redis is single-threaded, which means each command execution is sequential. Parallel commands will be stored in a queue and executed one by one.

We can have backup mechanism in Redis. By default it uses `RDB` snapshots. There is another one called `AOL (append only log)` which stores the write operations I guess so all values can be replayed back after a crash.

In single node environment, using `setnx` is fine for locking. But when it comes to `master-slave` there could be a possibilitiy of some issues. Such as master-slave copy goes out of sync and master goes down. In that case slave will be promoted to master but it won't contain few keys.

They have an algorithm called `redlock` for this use case. But I'm still exploring the possibilities and my use cases.
