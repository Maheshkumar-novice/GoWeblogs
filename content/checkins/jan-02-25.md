Welcome 2025!

A new year, same me :)

Today I was reading https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~pavlo/blog/2025/01/2024-databases-retrospective.html this blog about the state of the DBs in 2024. It was good reading.

I've explored new tools and blogs from this blog. Dumping them here for now (I've already stored them in raindrop).

* https://www.dragonflydb.io/ - similar to redis
* https://antirez.com/latest/0 - redis creator's blog
* cmu video about DBs - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZbwD1gzjLk&t=2018s
* cmu course videos about DB - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=APqWIjtzNGE&t=4941s

Andy Pavlo's blog itself is a great knowledge base IMO. I'll go through them later.

Now I've some energy left to go through few more HN posts.

My eyes hurt, I should take more breaks from system and focus on my health. Maybe that is my new year resolution lol.

I'll explore more on duck db in future.
