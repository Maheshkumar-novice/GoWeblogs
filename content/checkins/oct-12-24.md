I found `raindrop.io` to be useful for storing the links and bookmarks. This is what I was expecting. I was planning to build something like this on my own. But no need for that now as this has everything I've expected. 

Now I just need to migrate things from `discord` to here. No urgent for now. I can do later. Probably I'll export all the links first then I'll do one by one sometime later in future. Now I don't have the need to do this process.

I've enough in my bucket now. I still didn't explore to contribute as part of this Hacktoberfest yet. I also need to continue reading the book of DSA for this year's advent of code event. So probably I should make some notes/to-do to make sure everything goes smooth and not clogging up my mind.

I've also explored the source of kombu and celery. That lead me to reading about things like LBYL and such things. This also lead me to explore more about `fork` vs `spawn`. I've few scripts written while learning this. I'll post in TIL.

I had a chance to checkout python 3.13. I checked a few things in the interactive interpreter. Finally, they added the multiline-history. Like that. Also the colored errors and exceptions are a nice inclusion as well. They've also included useful error messages when we name our files with the same name as installed or standard libs.

I want to explore about their free-threaded mode and JIT but not for now...
