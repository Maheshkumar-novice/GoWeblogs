Tried `claude` for the first time and I must say, I'm very impressed. The response from the model and as well as the UX of the application is very superior and easy to use. The artifact window is very useful. It is faster than I expected.

Now I'm going to try `llama 3.2 1B` model. Let's see...It is very nice. I've also tried `llama 3.2 3B` model also, I'm very happy to run these models. These are faster than I expected. I used the model with `zed` and it tried to answer my questions (not very accurate).

I am planning to run a fine-tuning process with `axolotl`.
